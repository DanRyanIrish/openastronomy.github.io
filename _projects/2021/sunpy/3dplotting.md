This is an awesome project idea for suborg.

#### Description

There's already some basic code for 3D plotting.

#### Milestones (if any)

- Create a new package for 3D plotting of sunpy maps
- Add 3D plotting of PFSS solutions and field lines from pfsspy
- Other 3D plotting functionality (there are lots of extensions I can think of)

##### Coding starts
