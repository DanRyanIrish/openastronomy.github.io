This project will provide access to data in an programmatic way.

#### Description

The current scraper implementation has been very useful to provide access to
many data archives, however, it has some limitations and the work around are
making the code very unsustainable.

- Fully scope out what we need scraper to achieve
- Figure out how to use parse (probably with patches upstream)
- Implement it.
